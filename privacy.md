# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: December 4, 2024

## Overview

This privacy policy describes how the Ollama Chrome Extension ("Extension") handles user data. Our extension is designed with privacy in mind and operates entirely locally on your machine.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What We Collect
- Chat messages and prompts that you enter into the extension
- Extension settings and preferences

### How We Use Data
All data processing occurs locally on your device:
- Chat messages are sent only to your locally running Ollama instance
- Settings are stored locally in your browser
- No data is transmitted to external servers

### Data Storage
- All conversations and settings are stored locally in your browser
- Data remains on your device and is never transmitted to our servers

## Data Sharing

We do not share any user data because:
- We do not collect any user data
- All operations occur locally between your browser and your local Ollama instance
- No data is transmitted outside your device

## Technical Requirements

The extension requires certain permissions to function:
- Host permissions (localhost only): Required to communicate with your local Ollama instance
- declarativeNetRequest: Required to establish secure connection with local Ollama server

## Data Retention

Since all data is stored locally:
- You control all your data
- Data persists until you clear your browser data or uninstall the extension
- No backups are maintained on external servers

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We will update this privacy policy as needed. Users will be notified of any material changes through the extension or Chrome Web Store listing.

## Contact

For privacy-related questions, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.

*Note: This extension is not affiliated with Ollama. It is an independent tool designed to work with locally installed Ollama instances.*
